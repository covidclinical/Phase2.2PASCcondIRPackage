This package implements conditional independence testing procedures to
identify codified concepts related to prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in
4CE Phase2.2 Data. Running this package necessitates refreshed Phase2.2
data to Feb 1, 2022 inclusive of all patient cohorts the 4CE Consortium.

4CE analysts at each participating healthcare system can follow the
steps described bellow to run the analysis locally, using their
healthcare systemâ€™s 2.2 data. The summarized results are then shared and
combined with those obtained from other healthcare systems. Those
phenotype conditional testing results regroup PheCode, beta coefficient,
standard errors, p-values, and prevalence estimates.

### 1. Install the package

Install the development version of **Phase2.2PASCcondIRPackage** from
GitHub using remotes:

``` r
remotes::install_github('covidclinical/Phase2.2PASCcondIRPackage',
                        upgrade = FALSE)
library(Phase2.2PASCcondIRPackage)
```

### 2. Run the Analysis

Please note that the analysis can take up to two days to run.

``` r
siteid=""     # specify the site ID (capital letters)
dir.data=""   # specify the input data directory, where the phase 2.2 data is saved
dir.repo=""   # specify the output data directory, where the results will be saved

# run the analysis
runAnalysis(dir.data, dir.repo)
```

### 3. Submit the results

<!-- #### 1. Submit the results via GitHub -->
<!-- Finally, please submit the results to [Phase2.2PASCcondISummariesPublic](https://github.com/covidclinical/Phase2.2PASCcondISummariesPublic): -->
<!-- - Share your GitHub handle with @Clara-Lea via direct message so you can be added as contributor to the repository. -->
<!-- - Note that you will need to use a token to access **private** repositories. Please see the details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). -->
<!-- To generate a new token, go to your GitHub settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate. -->
<!-- Then, run the following: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- submitAnalysis() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- #### 2. Alternatively, you can submit the results via Slack.  -->

Your results will be saved under the path that you specify in
`dir.repo`, as an .Rdata file. Please share the results with @Harrison
and @Clara-Lea via the Slack channel #post-acute-sequelae.

Thank you very much for your contribution!
